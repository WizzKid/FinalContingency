Hello,

Here you will find the scripts I worked on in Final Contingency.


Although I worked on other scripts collaboratively to test and fix bugs, I will only post those that I worked on the majority of.

These scripts include - Audio, Weapons, Enemies, Magnetic Boots, Scene transitions, alternate 3rd person camera, and some utility scripts.
